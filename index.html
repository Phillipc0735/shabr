Home: Fun for Everyone
Come make a new memory with us. There's nothing else like it.
Fun for both adults and kids. All are welcome!
Afraid of heights? You won't be after you slow-dance with the sky.

Info: All the information you'll need<br>
<ol><li>Time
Due to climatic conditions, we can safely fly only in the early morning hours with our primary season and most beautiful months being May through November. Since our launch times vary through the seasons, we ask all our guests to call ahead for the exact meeting time.
</li><li>Weather
High winds and/or inclement weather prevent us from flying. We ask all our guests to contact us in the early afternoon prior to their scheduled flight between 12:00 noon and 2:00 p.m. to verify that the forecasted weather conditions will allow their balloon flight.
</li><li>Flight
Our actual flight time is approximately one to one and a half hours averaging closer to one and a half hours and we suggest to allow three to three and a half hours for the entire adventure.</li>
<li>Participation
We encourage all of our guests, if they wish, to participate in both the inflation and deflation of the balloon. We have found it adds greatly to the fun of the entire ballooning experience.
